This project investigates bank customer churn behavior using a real-world dataset. It applies Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, to uncover actionable insights, predict churn probabilities to enhance customer retention.

The project focuses on identifying key drivers of customer churn, building predictive models to classify churners, and forecasting future churn trends for proactive business strategies.

Key Features of the Project:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution to identify imbalances in the dataset.
- Analyzed feature relationships with churn, such as:
  - Age and churn patterns.
  - CreditScore impact on churn.
  - Geographic variations in churn.
- Visualized correlations and key drivers using heatmaps and pair plots.

2. Machine Learning Models
- Preprocessed data with encoding, scaling, and stratified splitting.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn.
  - Achieved high performance with an ROC AUC Score of 85%.
- Visualized feature importances to understand critical churn predictors.
